#Tzeentch

Tzeentch is a set of tools to effectively start fuzzing the android environment.

###Previous versions
The previous versions consisted of a set of scripts to be able to fuzz various media formats on Android. These scripts can still be found in the [scripts directory](https://github.com/KarmaHostage/Tzeentch/tree/master/scripts).

###Work in Progress
If you're reading this, we apoligize. At this exact moment, we're busing converting all of our scripts to an extensible framework for fuzzing the Android environment. We'll write a blogpost on [karmahostage](https://karmahostage.com) once we're releasing version 1.0.
