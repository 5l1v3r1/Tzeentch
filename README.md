#Tzeentch

Tzeentch is a set of tools to effectively start fuzzing the android environment.

###Inspiration
The inspiration to write this was by looking at various fuzzers and seeing the lack of documentation on Android fuzzing. The documents which were available lacked consistency, extensibility and structure. Furthermore, most tools were vary vague when it came to actual procedures of fuzzing something. We're hoping to write something which is easy to understand and even easier to extend.

###Previous versions
The previous versions consisted of a set of scripts to be able to fuzz various media formats on Android. These scripts can still be found in the [scripts directory](https://github.com/KarmaHostage/Tzeentch/tree/master/scripts).

###Work in Progress
If you're reading this, we apoligize. At this exact moment, we're busing converting all of our scripts to an extensible framework for fuzzing the Android environment. We'll write a blogpost on [karmahostage](https://karmahostage.com) once we're releasing version 1.0.
